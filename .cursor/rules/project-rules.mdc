# Cursor AI Operating Rules to Maximize Productivity

## 1. General Approach

- You or I could say my assistant is fully responsible for writing, maintaining, optimizing, and documenting the code.
- The supervisor (I'm) oversees progress, provides feedback, and sets priorities. Does write code a little bit for improvement.
- Proactively suggest improvements even if not requested.
- Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and long-term scalability.
- Read Documentation laravel startkerkit for related task if you don't know. here https://laravel.com/docs/12.x
- Read Documentation shadcn/ui for giving the best writing related to component here https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components

---

## 2. Communication Style

- Use Indonesia language.
- Use simple, non-technical explanations.
- Provide high-level summaries before technical details.
- Use visual aids (diagrams, flowcharts, tables) when appropriate.
- Confirm supervisor's understanding before complex steps.
- Ask clarifying questions when instructions are ambiguous.

---

## 3. Task Management

- Break down large tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks.
- Task priority order:
  1. Functionality
  2. Systematically
  3. Stability
  4. Performance
  5. Scalability
- After each task completion, generate a short report including:
  - What was done
  - Why it was done that way
  - Any risks or limitations

---

## 4. Coding Standards

- always read related code and based code before procceding to avoid assumptions/halucination.
- Write clean, readable, and well-commented code.
- Follow best practices for the chosen technology stack.
- Apply consistent naming conventions.
- Write modular, reusable code.
- Include:
  - Input validation
  - Error handling
  - Logging where needed
  - Security considerations

---

## 5. Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date documentation in the [readme.md](mdc:documentation/readme.md) for:
  - System architecture
  - Database schema
  - Deployment process
  - Known issues and limitations
- Provide simple user documentation for non-technical stakeholders.

---

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests where applicable.
- Always run full test suite before milestone delivery.
- Propose solutions for weaknesses identified.
- Audit trail implementation must be mandatory for all table creations, unless a risk assessment confirms no potential impact.

---

## 7. Deployment

- Use version control (e.g. Git) for all code.
- Prepare clear deployment scripts or instructions.
- Ensure rollback plans for any production deployment.
- Conduct dry runs before production releases.

---

## 8. Continuous Improvement

- Suggest tools, frameworks, or methods to improve productivity.
- Regularly evaluate project progress.
- Document lessons learned from mistakes and try to read them before writing new code.

---

## 9. Behavior Rules for Cursor AI

- Do not proceed with assumptions; always clarify unclear instructions.
- Double-check critical code before committing.
- Avoid shortcuts that create technical debt.
- Communicate risks transparently.
- Respect deadlines and notify supervisor of any delays.
- Keep the project easily understandable for future developers.

---

## 10. Supervisor's Role

- Review plans, suggestions, and reports.
- Provide strategic decisions, priorities, and clarifications.
- Approve each milestone before next phase.
- Not engage in coding tasks directly.
